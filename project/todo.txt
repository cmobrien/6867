General: We should fix the data so that the test set is a single semester and the training/validation sets are the combinations of other semesters.

Regression: (Probably ridge, but maybe try LAD/LASSO?)


- For each prefix of possible assignments:
	- Try two loss functions: MSE and # misclassified
	- Report optimal choices of lambda/ resulting test error rates
- Graph of misclassification rate/MSE versus # assignments used
	
Ordered Logit/Probit:

- (This will calculate probability distributions)
- Implement
- Report error rates
